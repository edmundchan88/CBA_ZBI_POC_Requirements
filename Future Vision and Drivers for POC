## Stages of Evolution

# On POC Coverage in terms of Implementation Stages
1. What are the stages envisioned for the ZBI POD Implementation in terms of features offered and interaction with the legacy world?
2. Which stages will the immediate POC cover for the future POD Architecture?
3. How many stages of POC will there be?

# Immediate Stage POD/POC Architecture, Features and POC Requirements
1. What is the duration of the first/immediate round of POC?
2. What is the hardware configuration for the POC equipment? 
3. What are the services in terms of compute capacity, networking and storage?
4. What software moving parts are in the POC and how do that work in delivering required services?
5. How is Security Zone Model enforced?
6. How is network connectivity done?
7. How is compute capacity delivered?
8. How is storage service delivered for ephemeral use cases?
9. How is storage service delivered for persistent use cases?
10. How is storage encryption done for both HDFS and non HDFS?
11. How is authorisation done?
12. What are the boundaries of the POC.
13. How does the POC represent the future POD?
